# healthcloud

This is my thesis project, called "Healthcare Management using AWS servces", where I developed a web application using the Django framework. 
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the strong potential of cloud computing in the domain of healthcare with the help of a machine learning algorithm built in Amazon SageMaker. 
This model provided healthcare insights related to a possible risk for cardiovascular disease based on patient medical data as input.
